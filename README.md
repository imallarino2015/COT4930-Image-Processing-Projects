Various projects involving image analysis and manipulation

## Project 1
Project consists of two source files, generateImg.py and modifyImg.py, each being its own independent application. 

#### generateImg.py
Allows the user to either open an image or create a new image using either random noise or a predefined function editable in the generateImg() function. The user is also able to save the image to out.png.

#### modifyImg.py
